    <h1>I AM</h1>
    <h2>Sachin Ramesh Tendulker</h2>
    <h2>An Indian Former International Cricketer</h2>
    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <h5>India is a country where cricket is treated like a religion and Sachin Tendulkar is the God of cricket. This is enough to justify the achievements of Sachin Tendulkar.

        Sachin Tendulkar is considered to be one of the greatest cricketers of all time. He has millions of fans all around the world. During that time he was probably the only cricket player who was loved by other countries such as Pakistan, Australia, or Bangladesh. Sachin Tendulkar was born in the year 1973 on the 24th of April and had a Marathi background. His fatherâ€™s name is Ramesh Tendulkar, who was a renowned Marathi novelist. His mother's name is Rajni Tendulkar. Sachin Tendulkar met Anjali Mehta in the 1990s and married her in the year 1995. They have two children by the name of Sara Tendulkar and Arjun Tendulkar.
        
        Sachin Tendulkar is known for his opening batting as it allowed India to solve a decades-old problem of not having good openers who could give India a head start against the opponents. Sachin Tendulkar was very good at opening the innings and this allowed him to stay at the crease for a longer time and score as many runs as he can. Sachin Tendulkar has been a part of some of the greatest Indian innings that the Indian cricket team has won. Whether it was the Sharjah innings, Gwalior now or his 200 runs in the single inning, he has given the memories of the fans that no one can forget for many years to come.
        
        Because of his achievements, Sachin Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in the year 1994. He also received the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997 which is considered to be the highest honour in the sports field. In the year 2008 Sachin received the Padma Bhushan award for his achievements in the field of cricket.
        
        After the poor performance against the England team, Sachin Tendulkar announced his retirement from one-day international cricket and followed up by retiring from all forms of cricket in the year 2013. Sachin will be always remembered for his contribution to the game of cricket. He elevated the level of Indian cricket and inspired many future cricketing stars such as Virat Kohli, Prithvi Shah to pursue their career in cricket.</h5>
